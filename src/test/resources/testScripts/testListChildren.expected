# Test listChildren empty (no children)

created graph graph1

added node A to graph1

the children of A in graph1 are:

# Test listChildren sorted by weight

added node B to graph1
added node C to graph1
added node D to graph1

added edge 1.000 from A to A in graph1
added edge 1.000 from A to B in graph1
added edge 2.000 from A to C in graph1
added edge 3.000 from A to D in graph1
added edge 10.000 from A to A in graph1
added edge 10.000 from A to B in graph1

the children of A in graph1 are: A(1.0) A(10.0) B(1.0) B(10.0) C(2.0) D(3.0)

# Test listChildren cyclic graph

added edge 1.000 from B to A in graph1

the children of A in graph1 are: A(1.0) A(10.0) B(1.0) B(10.0) C(2.0) D(3.0)
